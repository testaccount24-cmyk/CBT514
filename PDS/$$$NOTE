  Hi Sam!

     I have attached what I think is a pretty interesting piece
     of code (of course no one else may think so, we shall see)

     The problem this code solved was this:

     I work for a software vendor.  We were having problems where
     versions of code that had already been shipped to customers
     was being accidentally updated.  (Once shipped, of course
     the code should NEVER be updated again, so we can refer to
     what the customer had been sent)

     RACF was no real help, since the Special users could still
     update the darn datasets.

     So I set up a special volume named HIST01, and copied the
     datasets there.

     This SAF router exit (ICHRTX00) is a pre-RACF exit, and
     allows me to blow out all users (except very special users)
     who try to do ANY updates to that VOLSER.

     Other interesting possibilities? Freeze the pack with
     SYS1.PARMLIB on it to keep sticky fingers off of it perhaps?

     Of course the usual disclaimer: Use at your own risk, blah,
     blah, blah.  I put it in an LPALIB by itself, so I can use a
     special SYSPARM at IPL to disable it, in case something
     horrible happens.

     In any case...

     Regards,
